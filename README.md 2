This code takes in a user input for the number of vectors, and then reads in n vectors, each of length n. 
It then compares each vector with every other vector to determine if they are orthogonal (perpendicular), using the dot product function which calculates the dot product of two vectors. 
If the dot product of two vectors is zero, then they are orthogonal. 
The program then outputs a message if two vectors are orthogonal.
